## Introduction

During my internship at BharatIntern, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting and challenging projects: House Price Prediction and Wine Quality Prediction. Each task required me to apply various data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as a record of the tasks I completed, including the code and documentation for each project.

## Tasks

Here are the two tasks included in this repository:

1. **House Price Prediction**: In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The goal was to create an accurate pricing model that could assist in real estate decision-making.

2. **Wine Quality Prediction**: For this task, I worked on predicting the quality of wines based on their chemical properties. I used machine learning algorithms to classify wines into different quality categories, helping to identify which factors contribute to wine quality.

Each task directory contains the following:

- **Code**: The code I developed for the task.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation explaining the task, the approach I took, and how to use the code.
- **Data**: Any sample data or datasets used in the task.
- **Results**: Relevant results, graphs, or visualizations.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore or use any of the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bharatintern-tasks.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific task directory you are interested in (either "House_Price_Prediction" or "Wine_Quality_Prediction").

3. Follow the instructions provided in the task's README file to set up and run the code.

## Usage

The usage of each task's code and specific instructions for running or testing it can be found in the respective task's README file.
